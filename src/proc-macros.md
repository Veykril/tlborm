# Procedural Macros

This chapter will introduce Rust's second syntax extension type, *procedural macros*.

As with the [declarative macros](./decl-macros.md) chapter, this one is also split into a [methodical](./proc-macros/methodical.md) and a (WIP) practical subchapter with the former being a more formal introduction and the latter being a more practical oriented one.

A lot of the basic information covered has been sourced from the [rust reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/introduction.html), as most knowledge about procedural macros is currently located there.

# Macros, A Practical Introduction

This chapter will introduce Rust's declarative [Macro-By-Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html) system using a relatively simple, practical example.
It does *not* attempt to explain all of the intricacies of the system; its goal is to get you comfortable with how and why macros are written.

There is also the [Macros chapter of the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html) which is another high-level explanation, and the [methodical introduction](../decl-macros.md) chapter of this book, which explains the macro system in detail.

## A Little Context

> **Note**: don't panic! What follows is the only math that will be talked about.
> You can quite safely skip this section if you just want to get to the meat of the article.

If you aren't familiar, a recurrence relation is a sequence where each value is defined in terms of one or more *previous* values, with one or more initial values to get the whole thing started.
For example, the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) can be defined by the relation:

\\[F_{n} = 0, 1, ..., F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}\\]

Thus, the first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, with the third being \\( F_{0} + F_{1} = 0 + 1 = 1\\), the fourth \\( F_{1} + F_{2} = 1 + 1 = 2\\), and so on forever.

Now, *because* such a sequence can go on forever, that makes defining a `fibonacci` function a little tricky, since you obviously don't want to try returning a complete vector.
What you *want* is to return something which will lazily compute elements of the sequence as needed.

In Rust, that means producing an [`Iterator`].
This is not especially *hard*, but there is a fair amount of boilerplate involved: you need to define a custom type, work out what state needs to be stored in it, then implement the [`Iterator`] trait for it.

However, recurrence relations are simple enough that almost all of these details can be abstracted out with a little `macro_rules!` macro-based code generation.

So, with all that having been said, let's get started.

[`Iterator`]:https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html

## Construction

Usually, when working on a new `macro_rules!` macro, the first thing I do is decide what the invocation should look like.
In this specific case, my first attempt looked like this:

```rust,ignore
let fib = recurrence![a[n] = 0, 1, ..., a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
```

From that, we can take a stab at how the `macro_rules!` macro should be defined, even if we aren't sure of the actual expansion.
This is useful because if you can't figure out how to parse the input syntax, then *maybe* you need to change it.

```rust,ignore
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n] = $($inits:expr),+ , ... , $recur:expr ) => { /* ... */ };
}
# fn main() {}
```

Assuming you aren't familiar with the syntax, allow me to elucidate.
This is defining a syntax extension, using the [`macro_rules!`] system, called `recurrence!`.
This `macro_rules!` macro has a single parsing rule.
That rule says the input to the invocation must match:

- the literal token sequence `a` `[` `n` `]` `=`,
- a [repeating] (the `$( ... )`) sequence, using `,` as a separator, and one or more (`+`) repeats of:
    - a valid *expression* captured into the [metavariable] `inits` (`$inits:expr`)
- the literal token sequence `,` `...` `,`,
- a valid *expression* captured into the [metavariable] `recur` (`$recur:expr`).

[repeating]: ./macros-methodical.md#repetitions
[metavariable]: ./macros-methodical.md#metavariables

Finally, the rule says that *if* the input matches this rule, then the invocation should be replaced by the token sequence `/* ... */`.

It's worth noting that `inits`, as implied by the name, actually contains *all* the expressions that match in this position, not just the first or last.
What's more, it captures them *as a sequence* as opposed to, say, irreversibly pasting them all together.
Also note that you can do "zero or more" with a repetition by using `*` instead of `+` and even optional, "zero or one" with `?`.

As an exercise, let's take the proposed input and feed it through the rule, to see how it is processed.
The "Position" column will show which part of the syntax pattern needs to be matched against next, denoted by a "âŒ‚".
Note that in some cases, there might be more than one possible "next" element to match against.
"Input" will contain all of the tokens that have *not* been consumed yet.
`inits` and `recur` will contain the contents of those bindings.

{{#include macros-practical-table.html}}

The key take-away from this is that the macro system will *try* to incrementally match the tokens provided as input to the macro against the provided rules.
We'll come back to the "try" part.

Now, let's begin writing the final, fully expanded form.
For this expansion, I was looking for something like:

```rust,ignore
let fib = {
    struct Recurrence {
        mem: [u64; 2],
        pos: usize,
    }
```

This will be the actual iterator type.
`mem` will be the memo buffer to hold the last few values so the recurrence can be computed.
`pos` is to keep track of the value of `n`.

> **Aside**: I've chosen `u64` as a "sufficiently large" type for the elements of this sequence.
> Don't worry about how this will work out for *other* sequences; we'll come to it.

```rust,ignore
    impl Iterator for Recurrence {
        type Item = u64;

        fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
            if self.pos < 2 {
                let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                self.pos += 1;
                Some(next_val)
```

We need a branch to yield the initial values of the sequence; nothing tricky.

```rust,ignore
            } else {
                let a = /* something */;
                let n = self.pos;
                let next_val = a[n-2] + a[n-1];

                self.mem.TODO_shuffle_down_and_append(next_val);

                self.pos += 1;
                Some(next_val)
            }
        }
    }
```

This is a bit harder; we'll come back and look at *how* exactly to define `a`.
Also, `TODO_shuffle_down_and_append` is another placeholder;
I want something that places `next_val` on the end of the array, shuffling the rest down by one space, dropping the 0th element.

```rust,ignore

    Recurrence { mem: [0, 1], pos: 0 }
};

for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
```

Lastly, return an instance of our new structure, which can then be iterated over.
To summarize, the complete expansion is:

```rust,ignore
let fib = {
    struct Recurrence {
        mem: [u64; 2],
        pos: usize,
    }

    impl Iterator for Recurrence {
        type Item = u64;

        fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u64> {
            if self.pos < 2 {
                let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                self.pos += 1;
                Some(next_val)
            } else {
                let a = /* something */;
                let n = self.pos;
                let next_val = (a[n-2] + a[n-1]);

                self.mem.TODO_shuffle_down_and_append(next_val.clone());

                self.pos += 1;
                Some(next_val)
            }
        }
    }

    Recurrence { mem: [0, 1], pos: 0 }
};

for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
```

> **Aside**: Yes, this *does* mean we're defining a different `Recurrence` struct and its implementation for each invocation.
> Most of this will optimise away in the final binary.

It's also useful to check your expansion as you're writing it.
If you see anything in the expansion that needs to vary with the invocation, but *isn't* in the actual accepted syntax of our macro, you should work out where to introduce it.
In this case, we've added `u64`, but that's not necessarily what the user wants, nor is it in the macro syntax. So let's fix that.

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ , ... , $recur:expr ) => { /* ... */ };
}

/*
let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1, ..., a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
*/
# fn main() {}
```

Here, I've added a new metavariable: `sty` which should be a type.

## Indexing and Shuffling

I will skim a bit over this part, since it's effectively tangential to the macro-related stuff.
We want to make it so that the user can access previous values in the sequence by indexing `a`;
we want it to act as a sliding window keeping the last few (in this case, 2) elements of the sequence.

We can do this pretty easily with a wrapper type:

```rust,ignore
struct IndexOffset<'a> {
    slice: &'a [u64; 2],
    offset: usize,
}

impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
    type Output = u64;

    fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b u64 {
        use std::num::Wrapping;

        let index = Wrapping(index);
        let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
        let window = Wrapping(2);

        let real_index = index - offset + window;
        &self.slice[real_index.0]
    }
}
```

> **Aside**: since lifetimes come up *a lot* with people new to Rust, a quick explanation: `'a` and `'b` are lifetime parameters that are used to track where a reference (*i.e.* a borrowed pointer to some data) is valid.
> In this case, `IndexOffset` borrows a reference to our iterator's data, so it needs to keep track of how long it's allowed to hold that reference for, using `'a`.
>
> `'b` is used because the `Index::index` function (which is how subscript syntax is actually implemented) is *also* parameterized on a lifetime, on account of returning a borrowed reference.
> `'a` and `'b` are not necessarily the same thing in all cases.
> The borrow checker will make sure that even though we don't explicitly relate `'a` and `'b` to one another, we don't accidentally violate memory safety.

This changes the definition of `a` to:

```rust,ignore
let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
```

The only remaining question is what to do about `TODO_shuffle_down_and_append`.
I wasn't able to find a method in the standard library with exactly the semantics I wanted, but it isn't hard to do by hand.

```rust,ignore
{
    use std::mem::swap;

    let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
    for i in (0..2).rev() {
        swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
    }
}
```

This swaps the new value into the end of the array, swapping the other elements down one space.

> **Aside**: doing it this way means that this code will work for non-copyable types, as well.

The working code thus far now looks like this:

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ , ... , $recur:expr ) => { /* ... */ };
}

fn main() {
    /*
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1, ..., a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
    */
    let fib = {
        use std::ops::Index;

        struct Recurrence {
            mem: [u64; 2],
            pos: usize,
        }

        struct IndexOffset<'a> {
            slice: &'a [u64; 2],
            offset: usize,
        }

        impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
            type Output = u64;

            #[inline(always)]
            fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b u64 {
                use std::num::Wrapping;

                let index = Wrapping(index);
                let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                let window = Wrapping(2);

                let real_index = index - offset + window;
                &self.slice[real_index.0]
            }
        }

        impl Iterator for Recurrence {
            type Item = u64;

            #[inline]
            fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u64> {
                if self.pos < 2 {
                    let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                    self.pos += 1;
                    Some(next_val)
                } else {
                    let next_val = {
                        let n = self.pos;
                        let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
                        a[n-2] + a[n-1]
                    };

                    {
                        use std::mem::swap;

                        let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                        for i in [1,0] {
                            swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                        }
                    }

                    self.pos += 1;
                    Some(next_val)
                }
            }
        }

        Recurrence { mem: [0, 1], pos: 0 }
    };

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
}
```

Note that I've changed the order of the declarations of `n` and `a`, as well as wrapped them(along with the recurrence expression) in a block.
The reason for the first should be obvious(`n` needs to be defined first so I can use it for `a`).
The reason for the second is that the borrowed reference `&self.mem` will prevent the swaps later on from happening (you cannot mutate something that is aliased elsewhere). The block ensures that the `&self.mem` borrow expires before then.

Incidentally, the only reason the code that does the `mem` swaps is in a block is to narrow the scope in which `std::mem::swap` is available, for the sake of being tidy.

If we take this code and run it, we get:

```text
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

Success!
Now, let's copy & paste this into the macro expansion, and replace the expanded code with an invocation.
This gives us:

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ , ... , $recur:expr ) => {
        {
            /*
                What follows here is *literally* the code from before,
                cut and pasted into a new position. No other changes
                have been made.
            */

            use std::ops::Index;

            struct Recurrence {
                mem: [u64; 2],
                pos: usize,
            }

            struct IndexOffset<'a> {
                slice: &'a [u64; 2],
                offset: usize,
            }

            impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
                type Output = u64;

                fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b u64 {
                    use std::num::Wrapping;

                    let index = Wrapping(index);
                    let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                    let window = Wrapping(2);

                    let real_index = index - offset + window;
                    &self.slice[real_index.0]
                }
            }

            impl Iterator for Recurrence {
                type Item = u64;

                fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u64> {
                    if self.pos < 2 {
                        let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    } else {
                        let next_val = {
                            let n = self.pos;
                            let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
                            (a[n-2] + a[n-1])
                        };

                        {
                            use std::mem::swap;

                            let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                            for i in (0..2).rev() {
                                swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                            }
                        }

                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    }
                }
            }

            Recurrence { mem: [0, 1], pos: 0 }
        }
    };
}

fn main() {
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1, ..., a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
}
```

Obviously, we aren't *using* the metavariables yet, but we can change that fairly easily.
However, if we try to compile this, `rustc` aborts, telling us:

```text
error: local ambiguity: multiple parsing options: built-in NTs expr ('inits') or 1 other option.
  --> src/main.rs:75:45
   |
75 |     let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1, ..., a[n-2] + a[n-1]];
   |
```

Here, we've run into a limitation of the `macro_rules` system.
The problem is that second comma.
When it sees it during expansion, `macro_rules` can't decide if it's supposed to parse *another* expression for `inits`, or `...`.
Sadly, it isn't quite clever enough to realise that `...` isn't a valid expression, so it gives up.
Theoretically, this *should* work as desired, but currently doesn't.

Thankfully, the fix is relatively simple: we remove the comma from the syntax.
To keep things balanced, we'll remove *both* commas around `...`:

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ... $recur:expr ) => {
//                                     ^~~ changed
        /* ... */
#         // Cheat :D
#         (vec![0u64, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]).into_iter()
    };
}

fn main() {
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1 ... a[n-2] + a[n-1]];
//                                         ^~~ changed

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
}
```

Success! ... or so we thought.
Turns out this is being rejected by the compiler nowadays, while it was fine back when this was written.
The reason for this is that the compiler now recognizes the `...` as a token, and as we know we may only use `=>`, `,` or `;` after an expression fragment.
So unfortunately we are now out of luck as our dreamed up syntax will not work out this way, so let us just choose one that looks the most befitting that we are allowed to use instead, I'd say replacing `,` with `;` works.

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ; ... ; $recur:expr ) => {
//                                     ^~~~~~^ changed
        /* ... */
#         // Cheat :D
#         (vec![0u64, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]).into_iter()
    };
}

fn main() {
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1; ...; a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

}
```

Success! But for real this time.


### Substitution

Substituting something you've captured in a macro is quite simple; you can insert the contents of a metavariable `$sty:ty` by using `$sty`.
So, let's go through and fix the `u64`s:

```rust
macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ; ... ; $recur:expr ) => {
        {
            use std::ops::Index;

            struct Recurrence {
                mem: [$sty; 2],
//                    ^~~~ changed
                pos: usize,
            }

            struct IndexOffset<'a> {
                slice: &'a [$sty; 2],
//                          ^~~~ changed
                offset: usize,
            }

            impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
                type Output = $sty;
//                            ^~~~ changed

                #[inline(always)]
                fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b $sty {
//                                                          ^~~~ changed
                    use std::num::Wrapping;

                    let index = Wrapping(index);
                    let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                    let window = Wrapping(2);

                    let real_index = index - offset + window;
                    &self.slice[real_index.0]
                }
            }

            impl Iterator for Recurrence {
                type Item = $sty;
//                          ^~~~ changed

                #[inline]
                fn next(&mut self) -> Option<$sty> {
//                                           ^~~~ changed
                    /* ... */
#                     if self.pos < 2 {
#                         let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
#                         self.pos += 1;
#                         Some(next_val)
#                     } else {
#                         let next_val = {
#                             let n = self.pos;
#                             let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
#                             (a[n-2] + a[n-1])
#                         };
#
#                         {
#                             use std::mem::swap;
#
#                             let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
#                             for i in (0..2).rev() {
#                                 swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
#                             }
#                         }
#
#                         self.pos += 1;
#                         Some(next_val)
#                     }
                }
            }

            Recurrence { mem: [0, 1], pos: 0 }
        }
    };
}

fn main() {
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1; ...; a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
}
```

Let's tackle a harder one: how to turn `inits` into both the array literal `[0, 1]` *and* the array type, `[$sty; 2]`.
The first one we can do like so:

```rust,ignore
            Recurrence { mem: [$($inits),+], pos: 0 }
//                             ^~~~~~~~~~~ changed
```

This effectively does the opposite of the capture: repeat `inits` one or more times, separating each with a comma.
This expands to the expected sequence of tokens: `0, 1`.

Somehow turning `inits` into a literal `2` is a little trickier.
It turns out that there's no direct way to do this, but we *can* do it by using a second `macro_rules!` macro.
Let's take this one step at a time.

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    /* ??? */
#     () => {}
}
# fn main() {}
```

The obvious case is: given zero expressions, you would expect `count_exprs` to expand to a literal
`0`.

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
//  ^~~~~~~~~~ added
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
# }
```

> **Aside**: You may have noticed I used parentheses here instead of curly braces for the expansion.
> `macro_rules` really doesn't care *what* you use, so long as it's one of the "matcher" pairs: `( )`, `{ }` or `[ ]`.

> This is important when using macros in a function body; it helps disambiguate between "parse like an expression" and "parse like a statement".

What if you have *one* expression?
That should be a literal `1`.

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($e:expr) => (1);
//  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ added
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     const _1: usize = count_exprs!(x);
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
#     assert_eq!(_1, 1);
# }
```

Two?

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($e:expr) => (1);
    ($e0:expr, $e1:expr) => (2);
//  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ added
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     const _1: usize = count_exprs!(x);
#     const _2: usize = count_exprs!(x, y);
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
#     assert_eq!(_1, 1);
#     assert_eq!(_2, 2);
# }
```

We can "simplify" this a little by re-expressing the case of two expressions recursively.

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($e:expr) => (1);
    ($e0:expr, $e1:expr) => (1 + count_exprs!($e1));
//                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ changed
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     const _1: usize = count_exprs!(x);
#     const _2: usize = count_exprs!(x, y);
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
#     assert_eq!(_1, 1);
#     assert_eq!(_2, 2);
# }
```

This is fine since Rust can fold `1 + 1` into a constant value.
What if we have three expressions?

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($e:expr) => (1);
    ($e0:expr, $e1:expr) => (1 + count_exprs!($e1));
    ($e0:expr, $e1:expr, $e2:expr) => (1 + count_exprs!($e1, $e2));
//  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ added
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     const _1: usize = count_exprs!(x);
#     const _2: usize = count_exprs!(x, y);
#     const _3: usize = count_exprs!(x, y, z);
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
#     assert_eq!(_1, 1);
#     assert_eq!(_2, 2);
#     assert_eq!(_3, 3);
# }
```

> **Aside**: You might be wondering if we could reverse the order of these rules.
> In this particular case, *yes*, but the macro system can sometimes be picky about what it is and is not willing to recover from.

Hopefully, you can see the pattern here.
We can always reduce the list of expressions by matching one expression, followed by zero or more expressions, expanding that into 1 + a count.

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($head:expr) => (1);
    ($head:expr, $($tail:expr),*) => (1 + count_exprs!($($tail),*));
//  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ changed
}
# fn main() {
#     const _0: usize = count_exprs!();
#     const _1: usize = count_exprs!(x);
#     const _2: usize = count_exprs!(x, y);
#     const _3: usize = count_exprs!(x, y, z);
#     assert_eq!(_0, 0);
#     assert_eq!(_1, 1);
#     assert_eq!(_2, 2);
#     assert_eq!(_3, 3);
# }
```

> **<abbr title="Just for this example">JFTE</abbr>**: this is not the *only*, or even the *best* way of counting things.

With this, we can now modify `recurrence` to determine the necessary size of `mem`.

```rust
// added:
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($head:expr) => (1);
    ($head:expr, $($tail:expr),*) => (1 + count_exprs!($($tail),*));
}

macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( a[n]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ; ... ; $recur:expr ) => {
        {
            use std::ops::Index;

            const MEM_SIZE: usize = count_exprs!($($inits),+);
//          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ added

            struct Recurrence {
                mem: [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
//                          ^~~~~~~~ changed
                pos: usize,
            }

            struct IndexOffset<'a> {
                slice: &'a [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
//                                ^~~~~~~~ changed
                offset: usize,
            }

            impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
                type Output = $sty;

                #[inline(always)]
                fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b $sty {
                    use std::num::Wrapping;

                    let index = Wrapping(index);
                    let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                    let window = Wrapping(MEM_SIZE);

                }
            }

            impl Iterator for Recurrence {
                type Item = $sty;

                #[inline]
                fn next(&mut self) -> Option<$sty> {
                    if self.pos < MEM_SIZE {
//                                ^~~~~~~~ changed
                        let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    } else {
                        let next_val = {
                            let n = self.pos;
                            let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
                            (a[n-2] + a[n-1])
                        };

                        {
                            use std::mem::swap;

                            let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                            for i in (0..MEM_SIZE).rev() {
//                                       ^~~~~~~~ changed
                                swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                            }
                        }

                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    }
                }
            }

            Recurrence { mem: [$($inits),+], pos: 0 }
        }
    };
}
/* ... */
#
# fn main() {
#     let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1; ...; a[n-2] + a[n-1]];
#
#     for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
# }
```

With that done, we can now substitute the last thing: the `recur` expression.

```rust
# macro_rules! count_exprs {
#     () => (0);
#     ($head:expr $(, $tail:expr)*) => (1 + count_exprs!($($tail),*));

                        let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    } else {
                        let next_val = {
                            let n = self.pos;
                            let a = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: n };
                            $recur

                        {
                            use std::mem::swap;
                            let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                            for i in (0..MEM_SIZE).rev() {
                                swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                            }
                        }
                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    }
                }
/* ... */

```

And, when we compile our finished `macro_rules!` macro...

```text

... wait, what?
That can't be right... let's check what the macro is expanding to.

```shell
$ rustc +nightly -Zunpretty=expanded recurrence.rs

The `-Zunpretty=expanded` argument tells `rustc` to perform macro expansion, then turn the resulting AST back into source code.
The output (after cleaning up some formatting) is shown below;
in particular, note the place in the code where `$recur` was substituted:

```rust,ignore
#![feature(no_std)]
#![no_std]
#[prelude_import]
use std::prelude::v1::*;
#[macro_use]
extern crate std as std;
fn main() {
    let fib = {
        use std::ops::Index;
        const MEM_SIZE: usize = 1 + 1;
        struct Recurrence {
            mem: [u64; MEM_SIZE],
            pos: usize,
        }
        struct IndexOffset<'a> {
            slice: &'a [u64; MEM_SIZE],
            offset: usize,
        }
        impl <'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
            type Output = u64;
            #[inline(always)]
            fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b u64 {
                use std::num::Wrapping;
                let index = Wrapping(index);
                let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                let window = Wrapping(MEM_SIZE);
                let real_index = index - offset + window;
                &self.slice[real_index.0]
            }
        }
        impl Iterator for Recurrence {
            type Item = u64;
            #[inline]
            fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u64> {
                if self.pos < MEM_SIZE {

                    self.pos += 1;

                        a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]
                    };
                    {
                        use std::mem::swap;
                        let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                        {
                            let result =
                                match ::std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter((0..MEM_SIZE).rev()) {
                                    mut iter => loop {
                                        match ::std::iter::Iterator::next(&mut iter) {
                                            ::std::option::Option::Some(i) => {
                                                swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                                            }
                                            ::std::option::Option::None => break,
                                        }
                                    },
                                };
                            result
                        }
                    }
                    self.pos += 1;
                    Some(next_val)
                }
            }
        }
        Recurrence{mem: [0, 1], pos: 0,}
    };
    {
        let result =
            match ::std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter(fib.take(10)) {
                mut iter => loop {
                    match ::std::iter::Iterator::next(&mut iter) {
                        ::std::option::Option::Some(e) => {
                            ::std::io::_print(::std::fmt::Arguments::new_v1(
                                {
                                    static __STATIC_FMTSTR: &'static [&'static str] = &["", "\n"];
                                    __STATIC_FMTSTR
                                },
                                &match (&e,) {
                                    (__arg0,) => [::std::fmt::ArgumentV1::new(__arg0, ::std::fmt::Display::fmt)],
                                }
                            ))
                        }
                        ::std::option::Option::None => break,
                    }
                },
            };
        result
    }
}
```

But that looks fine!
If we add a few missing `#![feature(...)]` attributes and feed it to a nightly build of `rustc`, it even compiles!  ... *what?!*

> **Aside**: You can't compile the above with a non-nightly build of `rustc`.
> This is because the expansion of the `println!` macro depends on internal compiler details which are *not* publicly stabilized.

### Being Hygienic

The issue here is that identifiers in Rust syntax extensions are *hygienic*.
That is, identifiers from two different contexts *cannot* collide.
To show the difference, let's take a simpler example.

```rust,ignore
macro_rules! using_a {
    ($e:expr) => {
        {
            let a = 42i;
            $e
        }
    }
}

let four = using_a!(a / 10);
# fn main() {}
```

This macro simply takes an expression, then wraps it in a block with a variable `a` defined.
We then use this as a round-about way of computing `4`.
There are actually *two* syntax contexts involved in this example, but they're invisible.
So, to help with this, let's give each context a different colour.
Let's start with the unexpanded code, where there is only a single context:

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><span class="synctx-0"><span class="macro">macro_rules</span><span class="macro">!</span> <span class="ident">using_a</span> {&#xa;    (<span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">e</span>:<span class="ident">expr</span>) <span class="op">=&gt;</span> {&#xa;        {&#xa;            <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="number">42</span>;&#xa;            <span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">e</span>&#xa;        }&#xa;    }&#xa;}&#xa;&#xa;<span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">four</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="macro">using_a</span><span class="macro">!</span>(<span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="number">10</span>);</span></pre>

Now, let's expand the invocation.

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><span class="synctx-0"><span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">four</span> <span class="op">=</span> </span><span class="synctx-1">{&#xa;    <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="number">42</span>;&#xa;    </span><span class="synctx-0"><span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="number">10</span></span><span class="synctx-1">&#xa;}</span><span class="synctx-0">;</span></pre>

As you can see, the <code><span class="synctx-1">a</span></code> that's defined by the macro invocation is in a different context to the <code><span class="synctx-0">a</span></code> we provided in our invocation.
As such, the compiler treats them as completely different identifiers, *even though they have the same lexical appearance*.

This is something to be *really* careful of when working on `macro_rules!` macros, syntax extensions in general even: they can produce ASTs which
will not compile, but which *will* compile if written out by hand, or dumped using `-Zunpretty=expanded`.

The solution to this is to capture the identifier *with the appropriate syntax context*.
To do that, we need to again adjust our macro syntax.
To continue with our simpler example:

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><span class="synctx-0"><span class="macro">macro_rules</span><span class="macro">!</span> <span class="ident">using_a</span> {&#xa;    (<span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">a</span>:<span class="ident">ident</span>, <span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">e</span>:<span class="ident">expr</span>) <span class="op">=&gt;</span> {&#xa;        {&#xa;            <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">a</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="number">42</span>;&#xa;            <span class="macro-nonterminal">$</span><span class="macro-nonterminal">e</span>&#xa;        }&#xa;    }&#xa;}&#xa;&#xa;<span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">four</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="macro">using_a</span><span class="macro">!</span>(<span class="ident">a</span>, <span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="number">10</span>);</span></pre>

This now expands to:

<pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><span class="synctx-0"><span class="kw">let</span> <span class="ident">four</span> <span class="op">=</span> </span><span class="synctx-1">{&#xa;    <span class="kw">let</span> </span><span class="synctx-0"><span class="ident">a</span></span><span class="synctx-1"> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="number">42</span>;&#xa;    </span><span class="synctx-0"><span class="ident">a</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="number">10</span></span><span class="synctx-1">&#xa;}</span><span class="synctx-0">;</span></pre>

Now, the contexts match, and the code will compile.
We can make this adjustment to our `recurrence!` macro by explicitly capturing `a` and `n`.
After making the necessary changes, we have:

```rust
macro_rules! count_exprs {
    () => (0);
    ($head:expr) => (1);
    ($head:expr, $($tail:expr),*) => (1 + count_exprs!($($tail),*));
}

macro_rules! recurrence {
    ( $seq:ident [ $ind:ident ]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ; ... ; $recur:expr ) => {
//    ^~~~~~~~~~   ^~~~~~~~~~ changed
        {
            use std::ops::Index;

            const MEM_SIZE: usize = count_exprs!($($inits),+);

            struct Recurrence {
                mem: [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
                pos: usize,
            }

            struct IndexOffset<'a> {
                slice: &'a [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
                offset: usize,
            }

            impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
                type Output = $sty;

                #[inline(always)]
                fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b $sty {
                    use std::num::Wrapping;

                    let index = Wrapping(index);
                    let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
                    let window = Wrapping(MEM_SIZE);

                    let real_index = index - offset + window;
                    &self.slice[real_index.0]
                }
            }

            impl Iterator for Recurrence {
                type Item = $sty;

                #[inline]
                fn next(&mut self) -> Option<$sty> {
                    if self.pos < MEM_SIZE {
                        let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    } else {
                        let next_val = {
                            let $ind = self.pos;
//                              ^~~~ changed
                            let $seq = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: $ind };
//                              ^~~~ changed
                            $recur
                        };

                        {
                            use std::mem::swap;

                            let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
                            for i in (0..MEM_SIZE).rev() {
                                swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
                            }
                        }

                        self.pos += 1;
                        Some(next_val)
                    }
                }
            }

            Recurrence { mem: [$($inits),+], pos: 0 }
        }
    };
}

fn main() {
    let fib = recurrence![a[n]: u64 = 0, 1; ...; a[n-2] + a[n-1]];

    for e in fib.take(10) { println!("{}", e) }
}
```

And it compiles!
Now, let's try with a different sequence.

```rust
# macro_rules! count_exprs {
#     () => (0);
#     ($head:expr) => (1);
#     ($head:expr, $($tail:expr),*) => (1 + count_exprs!($($tail),*));
# }
#
# macro_rules! recurrence {
#     ( $seq:ident [ $ind:ident ]: $sty:ty = $($inits:expr),+ ; ... ; $recur:expr ) => {
#         {
#             use std::ops::Index;
#
#             const MEM_SIZE: usize = count_exprs!($($inits),+);
#
#             struct Recurrence {
#                 mem: [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
#                 pos: usize,
#             }
#
#             struct IndexOffset<'a> {
#                 slice: &'a [$sty; MEM_SIZE],
#                 offset: usize,
#             }
#
#             impl<'a> Index<usize> for IndexOffset<'a> {
#                 type Output = $sty;
#
#                 #[inline(always)]
#                 fn index<'b>(&'b self, index: usize) -> &'b $sty {
#                     use std::num::Wrapping;
#
#                     let index = Wrapping(index);
#                     let offset = Wrapping(self.offset);
#                     let window = Wrapping(MEM_SIZE);
#
#                     let real_index = index - offset + window;
#                     &self.slice[real_index.0]
#                 }
#             }
#
#             impl Iterator for Recurrence {
#                 type Item = $sty;
#
#                 #[inline]
#                 fn next(&mut self) -> Option<$sty> {
#                     if self.pos < MEM_SIZE {
#                         let next_val = self.mem[self.pos];
#                         self.pos += 1;
#                         Some(next_val)
#                     } else {
#                         let next_val = {
#                             let $ind = self.pos;
#                             let $seq = IndexOffset { slice: &self.mem, offset: $ind };
#                             $recur
#                         };
#
#                         {
#                             use std::mem::swap;
#
#                             let mut swap_tmp = next_val;
#                             for i in (0..MEM_SIZE).rev() {
#                                 swap(&mut swap_tmp, &mut self.mem[i]);
#                             }
#                         }
#
#                         self.pos += 1;
#                         Some(next_val)
#                     }
#                 }
#             }
#
#             Recurrence { mem: [$($inits),+], pos: 0 }
#         }
#     };
# }
#
# fn main() {
for e in recurrence!(f[i]: f64 = 1.0; ...; f[i-1] * i as f64).take(10) {
    println!("{}", e)
}
# }
```

Which gives us:

```text
1
1
2
6
24
120
720
5040
40320
362880
```

Success!

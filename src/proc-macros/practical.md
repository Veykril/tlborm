# A Practical Introduction

This chapter will introduce Rust's procedural macro system using 3 relatively simple, practical examples, one for each procedural macro type.

There is also the [proc-macro workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop) another high-level introduction, and the [methodical introduction](./methodical.md) chapter of this book, which explains the system without practical examples.

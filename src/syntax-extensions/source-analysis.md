# Source Analysis

### Tokenization

The first stage of compilation for a Rust program is [tokenization]. This is where the source text is
transformed into a sequence of tokens (*i.e.* indivisible lexical units; the programming language
equivalent of "words"). Rust has various kinds of tokens, such as:

* Identifiers: `foo`, `Bambous`, `self`, `we_can_dance`, `LaCaravane`, …
* Literals: `42`, `72u32`, `0_______0`, `1.0e-40`, `"ferris was here"`, …
* Keywords: `_`, `fn`, `self`, `match`, `yield`, `macro`, …
* Symbols: `[`, `:`, `::`, `?`, `~`, `@`[^wither-at], …

…among others. There are some things to note about the above: first, `self` is both an identifier
*and* a keyword. In almost all cases, `self` is a keyword, but it *is* possible for it to be
*treated* as an identifier, which will come up later (along with much cursing). Secondly, the list
of keywords includes some suspicious entries such as `yield` and `macro` that aren't *actually* in
the language, but *are* parsed by the compiler—these are [reserved] for future use. Third, the list
of symbols *also* includes entries that aren't used by the language. In the case of `<-`, it is
vestigial: it was removed from the grammar, but not from the lexer. As a final point, note that
`::` is a distinct token; it is not simply two adjacent `:` tokens. The same is true of all
multi-character symbol tokens in Rust, as of Rust 1.2.[^two-lexers]

[^wither-at]: `@` has a purpose, though most people seem to forget about it completely: it is used
in patterns to bind a non-terminal part of the pattern to a name.

[^two-lexers]: Technically rust currently(1.46) has two lexers, [`rustc_lexer`] which only emits
single character symbols as tokens and the [lexer] in [`rustc_parse`] which sees multi-character
symbols as distinct tokens.

As a point of comparison, it is at *this* stage that some languages have their macro layer, though
Rust does *not*. For example, C/C++ macros are *effectively* processed at this point.
[^lies-damn-lies-cpp] This is why the following code works:
[^cpp-it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time]

```c
#define SUB int
#define BEGIN {
#define END }

SUB main() BEGIN
    printf("Oh, the horror!\n");
END
```

[^lies-damn-lies-cpp]: In fact, the C preprocessor uses a different lexical structure to C itself,
but the distinction is *broadly* irrelevant.

[^cpp-it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time]: *Whether* it should work is an entirely *different*
question.

### Parsing

The next stage is parsing, where the stream of tokens is turned into an [Abstract Syntax Tree] (AST).
This involves building up the syntactic structure of the program in memory. For example, the token
sequence `1 + 2` is transformed into the equivalent of:

```text
┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│ BinOp   │ ┌╴│ LitInt  │
│ op: Add │ │ │ val: 1  │
│ lhs: ◌  │╶┘ └─────────┘
│ rhs: ◌  │╶┐ ┌─────────┐
└─────────┘ └╴│ LitInt  │
              │ val: 2  │
              └─────────┘
```

The AST contains the structure of the *entire* program, though it is based on purely *lexical*
information. For example, although the compiler may know that a particular expression is referring
to a variable called `a`, at this stage, it has *no way* of knowing what `a` is, or even *where* it
comes from.

It is *after* the AST has been constructed that macros are processed. However, before we can discuss
that, we have to talk about token trees.

## Token trees

Token trees are somewhere between tokens and the AST. Firstly, *almost* all tokens are also token
trees; more specifically, they are *leaves*. There is one other kind of thing that can be a token
tree leaf, but we will come back to that later.

The only basic tokens that are *not* leaves are the "grouping" tokens: `(...)`, `[...]`, and `{...}`.
These three are the *interior nodes* of token trees, and what give them their structure. To give a
concrete example, this sequence of tokens:

```text
a + b + (c + d[0]) + e
```

would be parsed into the following token trees:

```text
«a» «+» «b» «+» «(   )» «+» «e»
          ╭────────┴──────────╮
           «c» «+» «d» «[   ]»
                        ╭─┴─╮
                         «0»
```

Note that this has *no relationship* to the AST the expression would produce; instead of a single
root node, there are *seven* token trees at the root level. For reference, the AST would be:

```text
                                          ┌─────────┐
                                          │ BinOp   │
                                          │ op: Add │
                                        ┌╴│ lhs: ◌  │
                            ┌─────────┐ │ │ rhs: ◌  │╶┐ ┌─────────┐
                            │ BinOp   │╶┘ └─────────┘ └╴│ Var     │
                            │ op: Add │                 │ name: e │
                          ┌╴│ lhs: ◌  │                 └─────────┘
┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐ │ │ rhs: ◌  │╶┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Var     │╶┐ │ BinOp   │╶┘ └─────────┘ └╴│ BinOp   │
│ name: a │ │ │ op: Add │                 │ op: Add │
└─────────┘ └╴│ lhs: ◌  │               ┌╴│ lhs: ◌  │
┌─────────┐ ┌╴│ rhs: ◌  │   ┌─────────┐ │ │ rhs: ◌  │╶┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Var     │╶┘ └─────────┘   │ Var     │╶┘ └─────────┘ └╴│ Index   │
│ name: b │                 │ name: c │               ┌╴│ arr: ◌  │
└─────────┘                 └─────────┘   ┌─────────┐ │ │ ind: ◌  │╶┐
                                          │ Var     │╶┘ └─────────┘ │
                                          │ name: d │   ┌─────────┐ │
                                          └─────────┘   │ LitInt  │╶┘
                                                        │ val: 0  │
                                                        └─────────┘
```

It is important to understand the distinction between the AST and token trees. When writing macros,
you have to deal with *both* as distinct things.

One other aspect of this to note: it is *impossible* to have an unpaired parenthesis, bracket or brace;
nor is it possible to have incorrectly nested groups in a token tree.
